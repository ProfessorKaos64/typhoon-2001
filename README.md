# Typoon 2001

Effort to preserve for use on SteamOS/Debain. Typhoon 2001 is a Tempest 2000 clone. This snapshot is from, what I assume per the original tarball [here](http://www.sourcefiles.org/Games/Arcade/typhoon_2001_r3992.tar.gz) revision r3992.

**Notice**:  
The game is a static binary, so there is no current way I have to correct any issues. Please _do not_ submit issues agains this project of this nature.

# About
This is a remake of the Atari Jaguar classic game Tempest 2000. T2K, as it is 
sometimes called, was originally created for Atari by Jeff "Yak" Minter as a 
remake of the arcade-game Tempest, which was in turn created by Dave Theurer.
